## Selected bibliography

The result of the approach presented in this repository has been to enable a much more systematic approach to processing DHS survey datasets in their entirety, so that we can ask new questions and produce new types of summary datasets from them. 

This has directly enabled and led to numerous published high-impact papers,  in the following main subject areas:
- Summarising treatment-seeking behaviour for children with fever
- Summarising use of antimalarials, classified by drug type
- Creating all the above datasets in forms that can be interlinked in order to model the effects of one on another
- Extracting measures regarding the prevalence of improved housing
- Extracting measures relating to healthcare outcomes in children (mortality, vaccinations, etc) in a way that can be linked to the housing datasets
- Re-creation of several DHS national/regional indicator variables at a cluster (point) scale - on behalf of DHS themselves - enabling the production of continuous spatial surfaces for these (published [here](https://spatialdata.dhsprogram.com/modeled-surfaces/))
- Extracting malaria prevalence rate ("PR") data in a consistent format across all surveys for which it is collected
- Extracting data on availability and usage of insecticide-treated bednets (ITNs) across all surveys for which it is collected
