DHS hierarchical data file parser
---------------------------------

This folder contains code in an IPython notebook (DHS_DAT_Splitter.ipynb) to parse data files in the CSPro .DAT format which is used by DHS for distribution of hierarchical (structured relational) data.

The code relies on a schema definition in a CSV format to figure out how each line of the data should be read. This schema is generated by the code in the MetadataManagement folder which produces it from the DCF (CSPro dictionary specification) file.

The output is one CSV file for each record type (table) in each data file.

Also included are some FME workbenches which were created earlier to do the same task; they broadly worked but were quite slow so are not fully developed.
