Contains a workbench to extract survey region polygons from the DHS API. However note that these do not have all the attributes of the versions available through the DHS Spatial Data Repository website. We don't have an automated way of downloading these in the repository but you can use the ArcGIS geoprocessing service that underlies the SDR website.
